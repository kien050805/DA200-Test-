## Project Overview:
This project implements a templated doubly linked list in C++, with support for basic operations such as prepend, append, insert, remove, search, and concatenation. It also includes comprehensive tests in the `mytests.cpp` file.

## Directory Structure:
- `DoublyLinkedList.hpp`: Contains class declarations.
- `DoublyLinkedList.cpp`: Contains method implementations.
- `mytests.cpp`: Contains test cases for validating the doubly linked list.
- `Makefile`: Used to compile and run the tests.

## Known Issues:
Currently, all methods have been tested and are working as expected.
